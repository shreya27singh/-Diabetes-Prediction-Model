# -Diabetes-Prediction-Model
The objective is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic
measurements included in the dataset.
- Utilizing machine learning algorithms, the project aims to analyze diagnostic measurements such as glucose levels,
blood pressure, and body mass index (BMI) to create a predictive model for diabetes diagnosis.
- By training the model on a dataset containing historical patient data, the goal is to develop an accurate and reliable tool
for early detection of diabetes, facilitating timely intervention and improved patient outcomes.
